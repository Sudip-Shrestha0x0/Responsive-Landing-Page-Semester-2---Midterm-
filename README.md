# Midterm Project: Responsive Landing Page

This was my midterm from the second semester at Algonquin College in my 2-year web dev program (4 semesters total). The task was to create a responsive landing page from scratch based on provided mockups, focusing on semantic HTML, accessibility, and mobile-first CSS. I built it with a clean structure: header, nav, sections for content, and a footer. Key elements include grid/flexbox layouts, media queries for tablet (768px+) and desktop (1100px+), a subtle animation for UX, hover/focus states on buttons with transitions, and Google Fonts (Lato for headings/nav, Karla for body/buttons). The page maxes at 1200px wide, uses specified colors, and follows accessibility best practices like alt text, ARIA roles, and skip links.

All code is validated, neatly formatted, and organized—index.html at the root, main.css in a css folder, images in an images folder. It was a step up from first semester, diving deeper into responsive design and polish.
